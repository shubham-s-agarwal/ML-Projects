Analysis And Implementation Of Modern Deep Learning Models For Question-Answer Classification

<b> Steps to follow <b>:

1) Extract the contents from the zip - the extracted contents should have 3 folders: Data, Src, Document
2) To execute the python code, do the following:
	a) Open terminal and navigate to the src folder.
	b) Execute the python file using the following command:

		> python3 question_classifier.py --train --config [configuration_file_path]

3) To change the configurations, navigate to the Data Folder, and make changes in the corresponding config file for the required model.


Important:

1) PyTorch must be installed on the machine to execute the code.
